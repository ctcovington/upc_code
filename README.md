This repository contains code to generate all results for the examples in [Covington & Miller (2025)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18261).

This code is extremely raw, though I have plans to clean it up to accompany the final version of the paper. Additionally, the code refers to the data as if it is one level up in the directory structure (rather than flat as it is presented in this repo).
